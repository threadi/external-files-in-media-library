# External files in media library

## About

This repository provides the features of the WordPress plugin _External files in media library_. The repository is used as a basis for deploying the plugin to the WordPress repository. It is not intended to run as a plugin as it is, even if that is possible for development.

## Hint

As user of the plugin you find documentation for protocols and handling in the [doc-directory](https://github.com/threadi/external-files-in-media-library/tree/master/docs/).

## Usage

After checkout go through the following steps:

### Using ant

1. copy _build/build.properties.dist_ to _build/build.properties_.
2. modify the build/build.properties file - note the comments in the file.
3. after that the plugin can be activated in WordPress.

### Using Taskfile

1. Run this command: `task prepare`
2. after that the plugin can be activated in WordPress.

## Release

### from local environment with ant

1. increase the version number in _build/build.properties_.
2. execute the following command in _build/_: `ant build`
3. after that you will find a zip file in the release directory which could be used in WordPress to install it.

### from local environment with Taskfile

1. execute the following command in main directory: `task release -- 4.0.0` - adjust the version number.

2. The release zip will be created by GitHub action.

## Translations

I recommend to use [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/) to translate texts for this plugin.

### generate pot-file

Run in main directory:

`wp i18n make-pot . languages/external-files-in-media-library.pot --exclude=svn/`

### update translation-file

1. Open .po-file of the language in PoEdit.
2. Go to "Translate" > "Update from POT-file".
3. After this the new entries are added to the language-file.

### export translation-file

1. Open .po-file of the language in PoEdit.
2. Go to File > Save.
3. Upload the generated .mo-file and the .po-file to the plugin-folder languages/
