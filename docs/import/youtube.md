# Importing from YouTube

This section describes how you can integrate videos from YouTube into your media library.

## Notes

Of course, it is not possible or practical to download entire YouTube videos into a WordPress project.

Therefore, the plugin only offers the option of storing a link to the videos in the media library. This link
can then be used in the project to embed the videos in pages.

It is still much easier and more reliable to use YouTube's own features directly.

## Importing videos

1. Go to Media > Add External Files and click on “YouTube.”
2. Now enter your channel ID and API key.
3. Click on “Show Directory.”
4. After a short moment, you will see the list of your videos on YouTube. You can now import them individually or all
   together into your media library.
